Eliptical gradient
==================

There are a few ways to define an elipse but having thought about it I think it is most useful to have a general method that takes three points,

the center of the elipse
the location of 0 degrees for the elipse
the location of 90 degrees for the elipse

This allows mapping any linear transform to be supported. 

Other ways to define the elipse can be built on top of this. If somebody wants a circle, a center point and radius can easily be converted into three points for example.

so we have

center : (x0,y0)
axis0 : (x1,y1)
axis1 : (x2,y2)

We can calculate t0 and t1 as described in paintmap.txt

from which you can evaluate the radius or angle for the elipse...

r = sqrt(t0^2+t1^2)

or the angle

a = atan2(t1,t0)

So a a circle can be define with a center point and a radius

circle = x0,y1,r

which becomes...

p0 = x0,y0
p1 = x0+r,y0
p2 = x0,y0+r

an elipse can be deined with a center point, and edge point and an aspect ratio

elipse = x0,y0,x1,y1,r

dx = x1-x0
dy = y1-y0
p0 = x0,y0
p1 = x1,y1
p2 = x0-dy*r,y0+dx*r

you could also define the aspect ratio as radius length "rlen" at right angles to p0-->p1

dx = x1-x0
dy = y1-y0
r = rlen / sqrt(dx^2+dy^2)
p0 = x0,y0
p1 = x1,y1
p2 = x0-dy*r,y0+dx*r
