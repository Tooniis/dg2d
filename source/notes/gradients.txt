gradient types
==============

linear gradient, gradient along a line
radial gradient, gradient along the radius of an elipse
angular gradient, gradient on the angle of an elipse

gradient lookup table size
==========================

Right now gradients use a 256 entry lookup table. This is probably adequate for simple cases but will produce banding in some circumstances, more stops, or less distance between stops for example. I have two thoughts on fixing this..

Make the lookup table size variable. The size could be based on an analysis of the color channel delta and distance between stops. Ie work out the maximum delta between any two stops, and you need a LUT large enough so that you'll end up with aproxemately that many LUT entries for the part of the gradient.

Interpolate between stops in the blit function.

Maybe a hybrid aproach would provide the best performance in different situations.

Interpolating bewteen stops is probably the better solution overall.
